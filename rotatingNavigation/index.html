            <h1>Rotating Navigation</h1>
            <p>
                Creating a rotating navigation menu using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript can add an interesting and engaging
                element
                to your website. In this example, I'll guide you through creating a simple rotating navigation menu that
                reveals
                navigation links when the user clicks on a menu button.

            <h2>I am Groot</h2>
            <img src="cat-image.jpg" alt="cat-image">
            <p>
                Groot, a beloved character from the Marvel Universe, is known for his distinctive appearance as a
                tree-like
                creature and his iconic phrase, "I am Groot." Possessing superhuman strength and regenerative abilities,
                Groot
                has become a vital member of the Guardians of the Galaxy in both comic books and the Marvel Cinematic
                Universe.
                His limited vocabulary adds charm and depth to his character, and he has evolved from a more monstrous
                figure in
                the comics to the lovable Baby Groot in the films. Groot's popularity continues to grow, making him a
                fan-favorite with his unique personality and emotional moments throughout the series.
