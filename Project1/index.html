          <h2>Missile Man Of pakistan</h2>
          <p>
            <b>Abdul Qadeer Khan</b> was born on 1 April 1936, in Bhopal, a city
            in the erstwhile British Indian princely state of Bhopal, and now
            the capital city of Madhya Pradesh. He was a Muhajir of
            Urdu-speaking Pashtun origin.[16][17][1][5][18] His maternal
            ancestors hailed from the Tirah Valley (now in the Khyber District
            of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan) while from his paternal side, an
            ancestor of his was an Uzbek soldier who came to India with Muhammad
            of Ghor, the 12th century conqueror, the reason why years later he
            would name his ballistic missiles as Ghauri.[19] In 1994-1995, Khan
            would have a mausoleum built over Ghori's grave situated in Dhamiak
            village around 80 kilometres from Islamabad.[20]
